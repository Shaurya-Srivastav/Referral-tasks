# Data Profiling Script

## Overview

This Python script provides an automated solution for profiling numeric data in CSV files. It calculates basic statistics (minimum, maximum, sum, and average) for each numeric column and also provides the record count. The script is designed to dynamically identify numeric columns, making it flexible for various datasets.

## Features

- **Dynamic Column Identification**: Automatically detects numeric columns in the provided CSV file.
- **Statistics Calculation**: Computes min, max, sum, and average for numeric columns.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes detailed error handling to manage and log potential issues during execution.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs information, warnings, and errors during the script's execution for easier debugging and tracking.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- NumPy library

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the required libraries. Use pip to install Pandas and NumPy if not already installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

## Usage

Place the script in the same directory as the CSV file you intend to profile. By default, the script is configured to read a file named 'Video-Games-Sales.csv'. You can modify the `file_path` variable in the `main()` function to point to your specific file.

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python data_profiling_script.py
```

## Output

The script generates two files:

1. **result.csv**: Contains the computed statistics for each numeric column along with the record count.
2. **data_profiling.log**: Logs all the information, warnings, and errors encountered during script execution.

## Functions Description

- `is_numeric(series)`: Determines if a pandas Series is numeric.
- `calculate_statistics(data, column)`: Calculates min, max, sum, and average for a given column.
- `profile_data(file_path)`: Main function to profile data; handles file reading and data processing.
- `write_results_to_csv(result, output_file='result.csv')`: Writes profiling results to a CSV file.
- `main()`: Entry point of the script; calls the profiling function and handles the result.

## Error Handling

The script includes detailed error handling, managing scenarios such as:

- File not found
- Empty data in the file
- Issues in reading the file
- Errors during data processing

All errors are logged in `data_profiling.log` for troubleshooting.

## Logging

Logging is set up to capture detailed information about the script's execution process. It includes timestamps, log levels, and messages. The log file is named `data_profiling.log`.
